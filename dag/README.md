# Background

This is the DAG generated for the community data model. The community data model was built to enable reporting on the community platform. Newsela provides a community platform for its teachers to engage with each other. There are multiple actions a user can perform while on the platform (ie make a blog post, leave a comment, make a forum post, reply to a comment, like something, etc...)
