# Background
Within our application a teacher can create, join and leave a classroom at anytime. However, the application only tracks current classroom associations so if a teacher is no longer associated with a classroom that data is lost forever.

The purpose of this project was to create a table that provided the entire history of a teachers relationship with a classroom. Example shown below.

| user_id | classroom_id | classroom_start_date | classroom_end_date |
|---------|--------------|----------------------|--------------------|
| 1       | a            | 2021-01-01           | 2021-01-15         |
| 1       | a            | 2021-08-01           | 2023-08-01         |

# Approach
The problem is a variation of the gaps and islands so that is the approach used.

There are 3 staging tables used, with each subsequent staging table depending on the prior.

1. teacher_classroom_date_ranges: order rows by date and add columns to compare to previous rows.
2. teacher_classroom_groups: group ranges together.
3. teacher_classrooms:

# teacher_classroom_date_ranges
1. In the "source" table, mysql_ebdb_tables.people_teacher_classrooms_history, a row is inserted into this table/updated everytime a teacher's relationship with a classroom changes. _fivetran_deleted represents a hard delete while datetime_archived would be a soft delete.

A basic recreation of the table:

| user_id | classroom_id | date_created | _fivetran_synced | _fivetran_deleted |
|---------|--------------|--------------|------------------|-------------------|
| 1       | a            |              | 2022-01-01       |                   |
| 1       | a            | 2022-01-01   | 2022-01-02       | true              |
| 1       | a            | 2022-01-01   | 2022-01-02       | true              |
| 1       | a            | 2022-01-15   | 2022-01-16       |                   |
| 1       | a            | 2022-01-15   | 2022-06-01       | true              |

2. The issue is that there have been multiple data ingestion tools used in the past leading inconsistent values across date columns as well as duplicate rows being generated.
3. In the inferred_dates cte I am grabbing all potential date columns and generating an inferred created timestamp.
4. In the classroom_dates cte I am creating an end date and ordering the rows into a inferred chronological order.
5. Finally the query uses window functions to grab the delete and start and end dates of the previous row for down stream comparison, orders the rows and removes rows of impossible or bad data.

# teacher_classroom_groups
In this table rows with overlapping date ranges are grouped together (date_group) which will enable the calculation of start and end dates in the final table.

# teacher_classrooms
Using the date_group calculated in teacher_classroom_groups, select the min teacher_classroom_start_date and max teacher_classroom_end_date grouped by the date_group to flatten the table.
